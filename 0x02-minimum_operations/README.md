# Minimum Operations Challenge

## Overview

This project focuses on solving the **Minimum Operations** problem, where the goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations required to create exactly `n` characters of `H` in a file using only two operations: **Copy All** and **Paste**.

## Problem Statement

You are given a text file that starts with a single character `H`. The text editor supports only two operations:
- **Copy All**: Copies all the characters currently in the file.
- **Paste**: Pastes the last copied characters.

Given an integer `n`, the task is to calculate the minimum number of operations to achieve exactly `n` characters in the file.

### Example
For `n = 9`, the steps are:
```
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
```
**Total operations**: 6.

## Function Prototype
```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of operations to get n 'H' characters.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of 'H' characters desired.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of operations required.
    """
```

## Example Usage
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} chars: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} chars: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

### Sample Output
```bash
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```

## Explanation of the Algorithm

The solution is based on the concept of factorizing the number `n` and performing "Copy All" when it's beneficial to double or triple the characters already present. The number of operations can be reduced by leveraging the largest factor of `n`.

1. If `n` is divisible by some number `x`, it implies that `x` operations (a combination of "Copy All" and "Paste") can quickly build up the `H` characters.
2. By identifying the factors of `n`, you can optimize the process by copying when necessary and pasting efficiently.

## Edge Cases
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is impossible to generate more characters, so the function should return `0`.
